# surfs-up

## Project Overview
I will be learning how to use SQLite, SQLAchemy, and Flask to build on knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. I will be:
  - Explaining the structures, interactions, and types of data of a provided dataset.
  - Differentiating between SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.
  - Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
  - Using statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.
  - Designing a Flask application using data.

## Resources
- Data Source: climate_analysis.ipynb, hawaii.sqlite
- Software: SQL, pgAdmin 4, PostgresSQL, VS Code, Python, SQLite, Flask, SQLAlchemy

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu's seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure I've hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop. Coming from the mainland, weather can vary depending on the seasons of summer and winter.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Determine key statistical data about the month of July.
  2. Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
  3. Compare your findings between the month of July and December.
  4. Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
  5. Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.

Based off of the data in regards to the weather in the months of June and December, I was able to compare the 2 different seasons in Oahu, Hawaii. The temperature in June was only a slight bit higher than in December. The average temperature in June was 74.9 degrees, with lows of 64 degrees and a high of 85 degrees, compared to December, which had an average of 71 degrees with a low of 56 degrees and a high of 83 degrees. Although the average between June and December was only 4 degrees apart, the low was 64 in June compared to 56 in December, which would possibly deter vacationers from visiting in December. 

The precipitation for June had an average of .136360 with a low of 0 and max of 4.43, compared to December average of .216819 with low of 0 and max of 6.42. So according to this data, we see that there is a higher chance of rain in the month of December, which could also deter people from vacationing during this season.

To further dive deeper to find out other reasons why seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business, I recommend obtaining data on how many surfers come to hawaii during June compared to December. I feel like this information is important, since the shop would be surfing related, then we will need to know how many surf goers come during those months. Another recommendation I would make is getting the sales data of local ice cream shops in the Oahu, Hawaii area. We want to know how ice cream sales are affected depending on the season. One last recommendation I have is obtaining data on flight prices in June and December to compare. I believe sometimes there are deals in the colder seasons that may lure vacationers to visit during this time.
