# surfs-up

## Project Overview
I will be learning how to use SQLite, SQLAchemy, and Flask to build on knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. I will be:
  - Explaining the structures, interactions, and types of data of a provided dataset.
  - Differentiating between SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.
  - Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
  - Using statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.
  - Designing a Flask application using data.

## Resources
- Data Source: climate_analysis.ipynb, hawaii.sqlite
- Software: SQL, pgAdmin 4, PostgresSQL, VS Code, Python, SQLite, Flask, SQLAlchemy

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu's seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure I've hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop. Coming from the mainland, weather can vary depending on the seasons of summer and winter.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Determine key statistical data about the month of July.
  2. Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
  3. Compare your findings between the month of July and December.
  4. Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
  5. Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.
